##### WEEK1 : CALCULATOR
_Directory_ : calculator 
<br />
A simple calculator is designed allowing basic arithmetic operations + , - , * , / over integers and floating point numbers.
<br />
<br />
_Instructions to run_
<br />
`make` : To compile the calculator files and create an executable `calculator.out` to run
<br />
`make tests` : To run any testcase.
<br />Sample test cases are provided. (test2.txt: division by zero expr is present)
<br />When asked for a filename to test, provide testcase file which is present in current directory only(calculator)
<br />
`make clean` : Removes intermediate and executable files.
<br />
<br />

##### ASSIGNMENT1 : SYNTAX TREE CREATION AND EVALUATION
_Directory_ : compiler      (_src_:_source files_ , _include_:_header files_)
<br />
Syntax tree with operators as non-terminal nodes and operands(numbers) as terminal nodes is created.
<br />By post-order traversal of expression tree, expression can be easily evaluated.
<br />
<br />
_Instructions to run_
<br />
`make` : To compile the compiler source files present in _'src'_ and create an executable `compiler` to run in _'bin'_ directory.
<br />
`make tests` : To run any testcase.
<br />Sample test cases are provided. (test2.txt: division by zero expr is present)
<br />When asked for a filename to test, provide testcase file which is present in _'testcases'_ directory only.
<br />
`make clean` : Removes intermediate and executable file.
